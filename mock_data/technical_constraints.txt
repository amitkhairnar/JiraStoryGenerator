# Technical Constraints & Guidelines

- All new backend endpoints must be developed using Python and the FastAPI framework.
- The primary database is PostgreSQL. Use SQLAlchemy for database interactions.
- The frontend is built with React and the "Starlight" design system components.
- All user-facing text must be internationalized (i18n-ready).
- All new features must include unit tests with at least 80% code coverage.

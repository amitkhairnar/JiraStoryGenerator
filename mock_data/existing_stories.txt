Title: User Profile - Add Avatar Upload Functionality

User Story:
As a registered user, I want to upload and change my profile avatar so that I can personalize my account identity.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Given I am on my profile page, when I click on the default avatar, then a file selection dialog should open.
- Given I have selected a valid image file (JPG, PNG) under 5MB, when I confirm the selection, then the image should be uploaded and displayed as my new avatar.
- Given the upload is in progress, a loading indicator should be shown over the avatar.
- Given I select an invalid file type or a file larger than 5MB, an error message "Invalid file. Please select a JPG or PNG under 5MB." should be displayed.
- Given the upload fails for a network reason, an error message "Upload failed. Please try again." should be displayed.
